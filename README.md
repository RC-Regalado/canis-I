# Canis I
In my attempt to understand how my 3D printer works, I am building another GRBL interpreter.

## The objetive?
Well, in my country, using step motors is expensive. Therefore, I want to comprehend how the Arduino communicates with the entire system. 
This will allow me to create a new system using gearboxes, rotary encoders, and regular motors.
